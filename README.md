# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is created so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This is the most time spent on a project so far in order to create a smooth responsive page design with several positions changing based on viewport width. JavaScript is used to make the page more functional and user friendly, as well as include Webpack and Object-Oriented Programming for loose coupling.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
